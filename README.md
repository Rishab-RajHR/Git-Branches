A branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. Branches let you work on features, fixes, or experiments in isolation without affecting the main (or master) history until you’re ready.


Helpful branch naming conventions

main or master — production-ready code

develop — integration branch (optional)

feature/<short-name> — new features (e.g. feature/login-form)

bugfix/<short-name> — fixes (e.g. bugfix/fix-crash)

hotfix/<short-name> — urgent production fixes

chore/<short-name> — maintenance tasks (deps, formatting)
